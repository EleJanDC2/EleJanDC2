### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Jan (John)

I has been interested in technical issues since childhood. I learned electronics and the basics of programming on my own. Later, I attended a technical school majoring in mechatronics, where I obtained the title of Mechatronics Technician. During my studies, I took courses in conventional and CNC machining as well as a soldering course. I started learning 3D design and purchased an FDM 3D printer. I also learned about other technologies. Currently, I am a 3rd year student of Computer Science with specialization in Embedded and IoT. Privately, I also run HomeLab which I use as: databases, website host, NAS, VPN, DNS, etc.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on :
  
       - A blind controller communicating via ZigBee and powered by solar energy.
  
       - Kinetic sculpture (Interactive via to the ToF sensor).
  
       - Port DOOM on lpc54628 NXP microcontroler.

 - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
   
       - Rust.
   
       - Basics of assembler.

      I intend to learn:
   
       - STM32 microcontrolers
   
       - Kubernetes

- Technologies I know:

       - C/C++
       - C#
       - Java (Java Spring, JavaFX)
