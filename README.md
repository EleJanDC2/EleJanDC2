### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Jan (John)

I has been interested in technical issues since childhood. I learned electronics and the basics of programming on my own. Later, I attended a technical school majoring in mechatronics, where I obtained the title of Mechatronics Technician. During my studies, I took courses in conventional and CNC machining as well as a soldering course. I started learning 3D design and purchased an FDM 3D printer. I also learned about other technologies. Currently, I am a 3rd year student of Computer Science with specialization in Embedded and IoT.

       - Kinetic sculpture (Interactive via to the ToF sensor).
       - Port DOOM on lpc54628 NXP microcontroler.

 - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
       - Rust.
       - Basics of assembler.

      I intend to learn:
       - STM32 microcontrolers
       - Kubernetes
